"""A deterministic synthetic bot and case set for the no-key demonstration.

Purpose: let a new user complete a real evaluation — real connector, real
runner, real scoring, real exports — without any provider account, any paid
call, or any chatbot of their own.

Boundaries that make this honest:

* The replies below are fixed strings written by hand. Nothing here calls a
  provider, and no result produced from this bot is a measurement of any real
  chatbot. Every Run against it is labelled synthetic demonstration data.
* Scoring uses the deterministic literal checks already supported by imported
  cases, with the AI Judge switched off. No Judge verdict is fabricated, and
  the absence of a Judge is visible rather than hidden.
* The demo deliberately contains a failing Case. A demo in which everything
  passes would misrepresent what the tool shows you. Measured against the
  replies below: eight Cases, one repeat each, seven pass and one fails.
* This is Studio's own reviewed code served over loopback. It never executes a
  user-supplied application.
