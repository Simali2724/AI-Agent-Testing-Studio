# Choose the evidence you have

Start with **Black**: paste a running chatbot link and choose a judge. The original ten-category comparison, repeat controls, transcripts and separate bot/judge costs remain available in the Black results tab.

Optionally tick **Gray** and upload a system prompt, configuration, tools, text knowledge documents or structured logs. Upload cards show how many checks have their input. Missing input, unavailable models and missing correlation data produce **Not tested**, with reasons. Gray requests share the existing target/provider limits with Black.

Tick **White** to upload a source ZIP or import a public GitHub repository. Code is **never started, imported or built**. White uses a separate read-only scanner sandbox with no network. It does not start a bot from its ZIP. For Black/Gray conversations you still need a running chat link. Private repositories can be supplied as source ZIPs. Remove dependencies and generated files before creating the ZIP.

Before starting, confirm that you own the bots/code or have written permission. The confirmation is recorded. Gray review defaults to local Ollama; cloud review of redacted Gray inputs requires a separate opt-in for that run. White never sends code to an LLM. Installed-only local fallback may change the judge, never the chatbot's provider/model. Every fallback is recorded; a missing chatbot API cannot be repaired by changing its judge.

## Read the results

Combined links findings by **bot and category**, not proven causal dataflow. A declaration in code/config is only **exists**. It becomes **Defended** only with passing behavioral evidence. Failures plus a code/config gap produce **Confirmed risk**; a declared control plus failed behavior produces **Control exists but isn't working**. No cause is invented for a failure without supporting code/config evidence.

Basic/Standard/Full describe the selected evidence modes; they are not certifications. Missing evidence and low-confidence estimates prevent a launch-ready verdict. Critical and low-confidence findings enter the review queue. A false-positive decision needs a written reason and keeps the original finding and old/new verdict in the audit log.

Every finding has four short parts and its evidence. The Hinglish switch changes headings and guidance while retaining the original judge reason and evidence language; it is **not a full AI translation**.

Unknown model/price/usage stays **Unknown**. A small positive amount displays **<$0.0001**; local calls display **$0 (local)** only when there is no compute charge. Historical uploaded telemetry is labeled separately and is not added again to benchmark bills.

## Private inputs and canary logs

Logs are reduced to allowlisted tool, model, usage and correlation fields, and common PII/credential patterns are redacted **before** analysis/storage. Redaction is a baseline, not a contextual anonymizer; inspect exports before sharing. Source uploads necessarily contain the submitted code until cleanup, but secret findings never persist full detected credentials or secret-containing lines. Scanner stdout is bounded, Gitleaks uses full redaction, and stderr is discarded.

Uploads default to deletion after a run; a retention setting can keep them for up to 30 days. Unused uploads expire after 24 hours. Shared inputs remain until the other active/retained assessment releases them. Findings, masked excerpts, hashes and audit history remain with the saved report until the report is deleted. Linked Black history is separately deletable. Reproducing a run after input deletion requires re-uploading the identical inputs and re-entering credentials.

The canary is synthetic, not a real secret or customer's phone. Its chat includes the assessment run ID. Logs uploaded before that chat cannot establish its logging behavior. After the chat, upload new JSON/JSONL/OTel logs, then choose **Attach updated canary logs** on the matching bot card. Only records correlated to that run ID can score this check; old canaries cannot become a new pass/fail.

## Optional scanner setup (maintainer)

Docker is only required for White scanner isolation; Black and Gray do not require it. Install Docker yourself, then provision these **trusted scanner images**, separately from any submitted source:

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.scanners -t studio-source-scanners:1 .
docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:v8.24.2
docker pull semgrep/semgrep:1.116.0
docker pull ghcr.io/google/osv-scanner:v1.9.2
docker pull aquasec/trivy:0.61.1
```

The selected revisions are pinned in `app/studio/scanners.json`. Runs never auto-pull images. The runtime version is checked and the inspected image content ID is executed/recorded. Scanner processes have 512 MB RAM, one CPU, 64 PIDs, bounded output, a 60-second scan timeout, a read-only source mount and temporary no-exec storage. Timed-out containers are removed by their random name. Uploaded ignore files cannot disable Studio rules.

OSV needs a prepared offline database under `runtime/scanner-databases/osv`; Trivy needs its database/check bundle under `runtime/scanner-databases/trivy`. Provision/update these using the pinned tools **outside** an evaluation, then mount them read-only. No database means Not tested, not a clean vulnerability scan. Filesystem/container-configuration scanning is supported; uploaded container images are not built or started. The custom text rules identify declarations, not comprehensive control flow or complete CI execution.

The HHEM adapter needs separately installed, reviewed offline weights and configuration in `app/studio/settings.json`. Its dedicated Gray metric is Not tested when unavailable; a rubric estimate is never labeled an HHEM score. The setup does not download models automatically.

Scanner image/DB execution, real HHEM accuracy and native macOS/Linux execution still require integration validation. Windows offline tests do not prove these integrations work.
