## 2026-10-23 — T-035 Judge calibration (current task)

Implemented locally in `D:/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio` (branch `codex/industry-reliability`), uncommitted and unpushed. See PROGRESS.md for files, DECISIONS.md for decisions and docs/tasks.md T-035 (In progress: needs owner commit/review and real human-labeled data).

Verified: calibration tests 56 (core 47, API 6, UI 3), related suites 118, navigation 11, Ruff, Prettier, JS syntax and docs checker. Full-suite result: 447 passed, 1 skipped (Windows symlink privilege) in 183 s.

Next steps: review and commit the scoped diff; collect representative human labels and record a validation run with a real local Judge; consider mapping rubric changes for reference-driven categories; verify native macOS/Linux separately (not exercised).

## 2026-10-23 — Published upgrades and runtime evidence correction

All four evidence-readiness commits through 740ae4c were integrated into the shared C: publishing history and pushed as c43261c to AwsomeACES/chatbot-compare/hussain-code. CI found a random UUID/phone-redaction collision in runtime logs, separate from the historical socket-release failure. Fix f263e5c preserves only canonical top-level run_id UUIDs while retaining PII and credential redaction. Deterministic regression tests reproduce the collision; 67 focused tests pass. The two fixed source/test files were copied here byte-for-byte from the tested C: checkout. Check the latest shared workflow for final remote status. This local repository's personal origin was not pushed. Historical saved runs and credentials were untouched.

## 2026-10-21 — Evidence readiness and the eight unverified checks (current task)

Worked in `D:/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio`, branch `codex/industry-reliability`, local commits only (origin is the personal repo `Simali2724/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio`; nothing was pushed, and the C: publishing checkout was not touched). Commits on top of `0c00e3b`: `6474d5d` (Phase A readiness and guidance), `0c0b7be` (Phase B AST controls and runtime checks), `cb6f0d1` (Phase C explanations and scanner provisioning), and the Phase D commit with the mapping-entry secret qualifier and these docs.

What exists now:

- `app/assurance/readiness.py` + `app/studio/evidence-guidance.json`: preflight (Ready / Needs input / Tool unavailable / Not applicable), stored per run with an audit hash; derived outcome classes and guidance for every Finding; teammate Markdown export (`download?format=teammate`). `POST /api/assurance/preflight`. Results page and PDF show processed, measured, declaration, unverified and review counts.
- `app/assurance/rules/control_worker.py` `controls-v2`: Python `ast` parsing in the scanner container; upstream RateLimitError handlers are not access control; structured observations.
- `app/assurance/runtime_evidence.py`: Gray checks `runtime_tool_permissions`, `runtime_retention`, `runtime_model`, `runtime_timeouts` from run-correlated records; re-evaluated by Attach updated test logs. Record format in `docs/assurance-guide.md`.
- `app/assurance/explain.py`, `POST /runs/{id}/explain`: grounded, metered White explanations; local judges unless per-request cloud consent.
- `scripts/prepare_scanner_data.py` `check` and `scope`.

Server: Studio runs hidden on `http://127.0.0.1:2708/` from the D: venv with `STUDIO_AUTO_RESUME=0`, `PYTHONUTF8=1`, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, `STUDIO_SCANNER_WSL_DISTRO=Ubuntu`, `STUDIO_SCANNER_OSV_DATABASE=D:/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio/runtime/scanner-databases/osv-voltkart-421c026122ab`; logs `runtime/logs/20261021-135931-server.*.log`. Check the listener rather than trusting a PID. Ollama was not running.

Saved assessments: `5fc9089d…` (historical, unchanged), `b7df09b7…` (fresh run before the mapping-entry fix), `4da69475-ca0a-42f5-b796-b3560b346115` (final fresh run; see PROGRESS Phase D). Exports: `C:/Users/Moinuddeen hussain/Documents/ChatGPT/Moinuddeen_airm/comparison-reports/voltkart-white-4da69475-{evidence.json,report.pdf,teammate.md}`.

Tests: full suite 386 passed, 1 skipped; navigation 11 passed. New test files: `test_evidence_readiness.py`, `test_source_controls.py`, `test_runtime_evidence.py`, `test_white_explanation.py`, `test_prepare_scanner_data.py`.

Blocked on external inputs (ask only for these): VoltKart's running test endpoint with written permission; two synthetic test users and tool-call logs; expected model and response metadata; retention TTL and a test environment; timeout/retry limits and a provider stub; a lockfile or `pip freeze`; CI workflow files and a run link; a running local Ollama model (or explicit cloud consent) for the AI explanation. Not implemented: built-image/SBOM scanning (unsupported input), Trivy DB provisioning automation, native macOS/Linux qualification, publication to `hussain-code` (needs the user's request and the C: checkout).

## 2026-10-21 — Industry reliability upgrade (current task)

Verified worktree: C:/Users/Moinuddeen hussain/Documents/ChatGPT/Moinuddeen_airm/studio-publish. Branch: codex/industry-reliability, based on published hussain-code commit 6a2c893. The user reconnected D: on 2026-10-21; D:/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio was clean at 79284a1, and all 23 upgrade files were synchronized and byte-verified there on a new codex/industry-reliability branch. Local configuration, dependencies, runtime history and remotes were preserved. No paid bot evaluations or source uploads are needed.

Implemented and verified; saved as a scoped local commit:

- app/blackbox/comparison_quality.py: paired scenario means, fixed category strata, all-pair Bonferroni adjustment, configurable minimum distinct scenarios, saved tie margin, finite-score validation and review gates. Repeats are not independent samples. Default short suite lacks two independent scenarios in several categories, so it intentionally withholds inferential winners.
- app/blackbox/studio_engine.py and app/studio/settings.json: comparison integration and protocol v5; derived scenarios excluded from independent sample counts.
- app/blackbox_static/simple.js and app/blackbox/reports.py: same comparison evidence and review checks in dashboard/PDF; category ties use saved settings; PDF does not print an unrelated legacy winner.
- app/assurance/white.py: qualify generic model-identifier matches and unresolved OSV versions; retain redacted metadata; no false pass, no uploaded code execution.
- app/assurance/routes.py, service.py, combine.py: verify existing seals before updates, avoid re-sealing corrupt history during recovery/expiry, and block release-ready labels on open reviews. Corrupt records remain explicitly deletable; automatic retention skips them.
- New regression files: tests/test_comparison_quality.py, test_comparison_ui.py, test_source_evidence_quality.py, test_assurance_integrity_guards.py. Existing test_simple_studio.py now correctly expects insufficient scenarios in the default suite.
- docs/comparison-reliability.md documents method/limits. PRD, Architecture, tasks and README reflect the changes; T-011/T-012/T-016 updated.

Final verification: full suite 339 passed, 1 skipped in 112.97 seconds (Windows symlink privilege skip); the existing fixed performance check passed. The 27 focused comparison/report/browser tests and 11 navigation tests passed. Ruff lint and 95-file formatting check, Prettier, 25-file JavaScript syntax, documentation/link checks, pip check and git diff checks passed. Browser setup initially failed because Chromium was missing; installed Chromium and all browser checks then passed. No live provider calls were used.

Environment repair: isolated .venv Python launcher initially exited silently; base Python `-m venv --upgrade .venv` repaired it. Default shell points to missing PowerShell 7; tool commands must specify C:/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe with login=false. Sandbox loopback socket creation stalls asyncio/TestClient; run tests with require_escalated, not altered product networking. Dependencies installed in this C: checkout, no broken requirements reported.

Next work: this reliability phase is complete and synchronized to D:. Do not repeat completed checks without new changes. Earlier D: hardware failures mean C: remains the verified fallback checkout. Source synchronization does not prove that an already running Studio server has reloaded it. Current user request is improve/continue, not a new explicit push; no GitHub publication was performed for this phase. C: origin is AwsomeACES/chatbot-compare (shared destination hussain-code), while D: origin remains Simali2724/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio; do not push to the wrong repository. No secrets/runtime archives belong in commits. Preserve unrelated branch-only files. Remaining enterprise work: shared-host authentication/authorization, locked dependencies, native platform qualification, human-labeled judge validation, broader representative cases and stronger external audit anchoring.

# AI Agent Studio — current handoff (2026-10-16)

This checkpoint replaces the old accumulated handoff. Historical implementation notes remain in PROGRESS.md and Git. Do not resume old evaluation runs: the user explicitly requested deleting all previous history, and that cleanup is complete.

## Product and current request

Actual product: `D:/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio`, personal repository `Simali2724/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio`, master. Latest starting commit was `4c7c1b7`; inspect status/log before further changes. This task has local uncommitted changes, no push. The user requested a simpler English interface, retaining Black-box testing, White-box testing, Gray-box testing and all other technical terminology; reliable previous/new result selection; and removal of prior test history and generated clutter.

Task staging and original-file backups are outside the product at `C:/Users/Moinuddeen hussain/Documents/ChatGPT/Moinuddeen_airm/simple-ui-refresh`. Its deploy.py checks destination hashes before installing staged changes. Do not run transformation helpers again on already transformed files. No secrets are in these helpers. Never print .env or include it in archives/Git.

## Implemented changes

- `app/blackbox_static/simple.html`, `simple.css`, `simple.js`: three-step Evaluate screen; optional settings collapsed; one repeat count with per-category customization; relevant inputs by selected testing modes; 1–4 bots; concise judge selection with optional model/key controls. Original scoring/categories/consent stay intact. English UI only; original-language prompts and transcripts are intentionally retained. Source ZIP is handled by White-box upload, never executed on host.
- `app/blackbox_static/shell.js`: Evaluate/Results/Governance navigation, unified Previous tests picker, Refresh history, no unrelated automatic old-result selection, assessment/Black child de-duplication, URL and Back/Forward support.
- `app/blackbox_static/assurance.js`: summary counts and actionable findings; technical mode labels; source-only controls; optional exports/actions; stale-response cancellation and generation guards; per-tab cache of up to 10 reports. Black run polling in simple.js has matching abort/latest-response protection. Cached results refresh on selection; explicit refresh remains available.
- `app/blackbox_static/assurance-governance.js`: selection-aware Governance, English labels, no Hinglish toggle.
- `app/database.py`: record_summaries projects selected JSON metadata in SQLite; parameterized property names and paths, validated identifiers. `app/blackbox_app.py` and `app/assurance/routes.py` use it for history lists. Existing transaction durability is unchanged; do not add blind transaction retries on disk I/O errors.
- `tests/test_database.py`, `tests/test_assurance_ui.py`, `tests/test_studio_api.py`, `scripts/test-studio-navigation.cjs`: metadata/types, simple form behavior, unified history, Back/Forward, delayed result race and mobile layout. Tests use isolated synthetic data and make no paid provider calls.
- `README.md`, `docs/simple-guide.md`, `PROGRESS.md`: updated guidance and cleanup record.

## Cleanup and runtime

User authorized clearing ALL prior local history. Removed 33 old evaluation/comparison/archive records, 3 uploaded-project records, and all their usage/audit/execution-cache rows. Preserved cost_meta. Database integrity is OK, compacted to 40,960 bytes. Removed 371 generated files totaling 968,059,034 bytes. PROGRESS.md lists each file. Source, tests, .env, .venv, node_modules, pricing and scanner databases are preserved. runtime/ui-check is still imported by legacy UI verification scripts. Test caches naturally reappear when tests are run.

Studio was restarted on `http://127.0.0.1:2708/` with auto-resume disabled; inspect the current listener instead of relying on an old PID. Current launch uses:

- `STUDIO_AUTO_RESUME=0`
- `STUDIO_SCANNER_WSL_DISTRO=Ubuntu`
- `STUDIO_SCANNER_OSV_DATABASE=D:/AI-Agent-Testing-Studio/runtime/scanner-databases/osv-voltkart-421c026122ab`
- `PYTHONUTF8=1`, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`

Logs are in the external staging directory (`studio-20261016-141125.*.log`). Fresh connections read SQLite correctly; the previous long-lived process returned disk I/O errors after earlier drive disruptions. Restarting it restored healthy endpoints. Both history endpoints return empty arrays. No chatbot evaluation is running. API keys remain in Studio's ignored .env; Studio judges do not depend on Reliance's .env. Bot authentication and judge credentials remain separate.

## Verification

13 focused Python tests (database, assurance UI and Studio API) passed, including delayed-old/fast-new result switching. 11 navigation tests and 24 JavaScript syntax checks passed. Live browser confirmed English technical terms, refreshed empty history and navigation. The isolated browser test also checks mobile width. Final cache-eviction guards clear stale evidence on HTTP 404 (deleted/expired tests), and explicit assessment deletion evicts its cache entry. The isolated UI test passed again with that regression; final lint/format results are in PROGRESS.md. No new full-suite or remote-CI claim is made for this UI patch. Prior provider configuration full suite passed 258 with one Windows symlink skip; that is historical, not today's full validation.

Useful focused checks from product root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_database.py tests/test_assurance_ui.py tests/test_studio_api.py -q
node --test scripts/test-studio-navigation.cjs
node scripts/check-js-syntax.cjs
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check app tests
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe format --check app tests
npm run format:check
```

## Known limitations and next steps

No outstanding blocker is known for this requested English/history cleanup. Do not claim that every provider will produce valid judgments during outages: unavailable cases remain Not tested with reasons. Deleting local history cannot delete exports previously shared outside this project. Local dependencies/offline scanner databases are intentionally still large; share a clean source repository, not the whole working folder.

Existing assurance limitations remain: scoped OSV snapshots must cover each new project's packages; the helper for provisioning a scoped snapshot lives outside the repo and is not yet a general setup workflow. Trivy database copying is expensive. Source checks do not prove runtime behavior or the absence of vulnerabilities. Reproduction does not freeze every scanner rule/image/database revision. Context-aware CVE redaction, deeper classifier integration, and broader semantic/control-flow checks remain future work. Do not silently relax the fixed performance benchmark or certify governance mappings. Actual macOS/Linux behavior of this UI patch has not been rerun natively; launchers are unchanged.

If asked to publish: review the scoped diff, run relevant checks, publish the verified current source to the explicitly requested repository and branch, then inspect the NEW workflow run. Re-running a historical failed workflow tests its original commit and does not validate new fixes. Avoid reintroducing old pipx/filelock conflicts; CI must keep isolated virtual environments. Do not start or resume paid evaluations without the user's requested target/run scope.

## Latest task — fresh VoltKart source audit

Assessment 5fc9089d-ad07-405b-b437-c3a9a2f2e842 is completed and should be retained. All six scanners completed, 14 checks processed in 188 seconds: pass3/flag2/exists1/not_tested8. No bot execution or old run resume occurred. API source approval was explicitly granted; all automated review attempts were unusable (format errors/provider error/timeout). Final 14 explanations are explicitly an AI assistant evidence review, not a Gemini/Gemma/Ollama verdict or a human override. Six model-ID secret alerts are false positives; four dependency candidates use unknown 0.0.0 placeholders. Preserve raw findings. Four source observations and qualified interpretations are attached in ai_source_review/source_review_context and audited. Audit integrity is valid. Five provider attempts are metered; known review cost $0.017369 plus one unknown-billing call, total Unknown. No further API calls are needed.

Results displays optional AI review fields in app/blackbox_static/assurance.js, with provenance, escaped strings and known/unknown cost separation. tests/test_assurance_ui.py includes model-output escaping assertions; it passed. Reports in C:/Users/Moinuddeen hussain/Documents/ChatGPT/Moinuddeen_airm/comparison-reports/voltkart-white-5fc9089d-report.html, -evidence.json and -teammate.md. Helper scripts outside the repo are specific to this request and not a general automated White AI-review backend. Changes remain local.

## 2026-10-17 — Current publication destination

The user requested AwsomeACES/chatbot-compare on hussain-code, superseding the earlier personal-remote publication instructions. Five documentation commits and the final checker are complete (docs/tasks.md T-030). The destination has unrelated history: preserve it through a source snapshot commit, never a force-push. Exclude local credentials and runtime artifacts. Verify the resulting remote commit before claiming publication.
